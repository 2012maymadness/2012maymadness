> Hiya.! I'm Candie. I'm hyperactive sometimes, if not most the time. Sometimes not. Please bear with me. >.<
>
> "What do you mean by hyperactive?" it means i cant stfu. Quite literally... 0_o (I'm a big yapper, okay.)

> Away / Busy are the only statuses that i typically use. IWC(caution) If i have busy on.

> Neutral about most ships, just do not force ships onto me. Same with headcanons.

> My patreon has more info if you'd like to know more about me.! Make sure you check the date updated - as i don't update it *that* frequently... whoops?
> 
> I neglect using tone tags most of the time, unless i feel like it is needed. Yes, my grammar is PRETTY bad *especially* during interactions at docks, so you don't need to tell me twice. Sorry in advance.
