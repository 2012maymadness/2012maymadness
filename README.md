> Hiya. I'm Candie. I'm hyperactive sometimes, if not most the time. Sometimes not. Please bear with me. >.<  　　　　　　　　　　　
> Status meanings for reference: ⛔ > Dry/slow responses. Probably in a sour mood, interact with caution.　|| 🌙 > Normal responses. By that - i mean i'm gonna be loud as ####.

> Neutral about most ships, just do not force ships onto me. Same with headcanons. (Directed towards the 'chance is in debt' stuff.)

> My patreon has more info if you'd like to know more about me.! Make sure you check the date updated - as i don't update it *that* frequently... whoops?

> I neglect using tone tags most of the time, unless i feel like it is needed. Yes, my grammar is PRETTY bad *especially* during interactions at docks, so you don't need to tell me twice. Sorry in advance.
