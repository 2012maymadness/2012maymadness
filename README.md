I tend to be hyperactive most of the time, and sometimes not. In general i'm a very loud talkative person but that tends to shift a lot. Whoops...?
>
> Busy usually means i'll be more quiet. Away usually means i'm my normal joyous self. Despite that, feel free to INT unless i have DNI in my name!

> For the basics... I neglect using tonetags. I tend to misspell a lot. (unless roleplaying) I am already taken, so don't try and hook up with me. (... or do?? i can't stop you. not saying itd work.)
>
> ALSO TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT - I AM NOT IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH  @c0ntractee I HAVE TO REPEAT THIS SOOO MANY TIMES. >:n stop shipping us out of character <\3 Joke or not, it makes me really.. eugh.
> 
> Even if we're friends, i rarely reach out first unless you're *extremely* close. Oorr if i'm feeling like it. I'm an introvert at heart T_T
